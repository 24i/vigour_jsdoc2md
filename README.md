> Converts jsdoc comment blocks to markdown
>
> **param** {*string*} jsdoc - the jsdoc comment block to convert
>
> **returns** {*string*} the resulting markdown

As you can see, it's doing the conversion in a most minimalistic fashion. Except from converting `@tag` to `**tag** :` and `{type}` to `{*type*}`  and removing the comment characters, it also removes the `@id` tag, which is non-standard and only used by [vigour-doc](https://github.com/vigour-io/doc).
